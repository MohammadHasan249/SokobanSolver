An AI model that solves many instances of the old and classic game of Sokoban in less than 5 seconds.

Includes a Manhattan Distance heuristic function, as well as an alternate heuristic function that expands upon the Manhattan Distance to include deadlock-states.

Also involves invoking A* and Greedy Best-First Search algorithms with the heuristic function.

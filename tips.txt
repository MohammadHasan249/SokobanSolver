1) Play a game of Sokoban, get a feel for what the test cases might be.

2) Manhattan works as a heuristic, so use that as a starting point.

3) Find deadlock states, which is when there is no way the game can be won.

4) Determine what you would do if you were the AI. For example, would you prioritize going for the largest snowball that isn't already on the goal?

5) Make your code more efficient - make it less computational-heavy, return early if you reach a deadlock, etc.
